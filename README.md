# Team Solar - SMEZA Code Repository

This is the repository for the code for the SMEZA. 

Code should be organized into folders based on the part of the system it refers to (e.g. the adjusters, LabView, etc.)

PCB information should not be stored here - put those files in the [SMEZAPCB](https://github.com/JReuningScherer/SMEZAPCB) repo. 

## Getting Started with using this repo
The primary branch for this repo is `main`. 

This is probably obvious but please don't commit directly to main; make a branch for your changes and then when you are done make a pull-request.
